My bootstrap Instagram Page

### Brief
Recreate the Instagram page using bootstrap.

### How I found it
* It went really well, found using bootstrap fine. Also made it responsive but only looks good at smallest width. As you drag the page in it starts to look weird.
* Would be good to go over responsive design when we have another chance.
